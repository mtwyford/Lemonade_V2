# APCS_LemonadeStand

## Careful - there is a steep learning curve here - so deep breath and we'll get through it.

StarterCode and Instructions for your first project

Did you play the game?  [Here's a good read](https://itstillworks.com/12414357/how-to-get-tons-of-money-on-lemonade-stand)


This project will be an opportunity for you to refresh skills on GitHub, and practice version control.
The project will evolve over time, and - as you add elements or layers of complexity, you will 'fork' or create versions, 
where the original working version will be the main 'branch' and other versions will be in test until you merge' them together.

### Step 1 - Play the Lemonade Stand Game on CoolMathGames.com (you may have to try a couple machines)

  As you play - pay attention to the kind of information that is asked of you the player, and imagine how things might be working 'behind the scenes'.
  
### Step 2 - Draw It!  Draw out a series of Text Screens that you imagine will be required.

  - Recommend Using Notability or similar screen - thinking about steps of the game.  
  - Question: what controls the game experience?  The User or the Software?  Are you in control of the game?  Or only elements?
  - Consider why this is important to how you design the game.
  
### Step 3 - Think about variables and methods() - We ar going to start with a simple class.

  - We know that every file needs a class header in the beginning or near the top
  - Only import statements come before the game.
  - So - at first - we are simply going to draw Blueprints for making a **Costco Lemonade Stand in a Box**.
  - We'll design a program to make a **generic** Lemonade Stand - and not try to start selling 
   - think building in garage first, and writing the business plan and emplyee manual
   - Let's head over to the [LemonadeStand.java](https://github.com/mtwyford/APCS_LemonadeStand/blob/main/LemonadeStand.java) file.
